# API-Financial-Planner

Creating two financial analysis tools with the focus on using APIs as part of the technical solution. 

The first is a **personal finance planner** that will allow users to visualize their savings composed by investments in shares and cryptocurrencies to assess if they have enough money as an emergency fund. 

The second tool is a **retirement planning tool** that uses the Alpaca API to fetch historical closing prices for a retirement portfolio composed of stocks and bonds, then uses Monte Carlo simulations to project the portfolio performance at 30 years.
